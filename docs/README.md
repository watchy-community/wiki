# Watchy Community Wiki

This is a community maintained wiki for the Open Source Hardware project,
[Watchy by SQFMI](https://watchy.sqfmi.com/).

We started this wiki so we could document our own processes, how-to's,
procedures, etc. We do not intend to replace the [Watchy Docs](https://watchy.sqfmi.com/docs/getting-started),
just create a place where we can add our own notes.
